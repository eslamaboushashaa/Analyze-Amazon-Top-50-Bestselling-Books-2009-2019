### summary of finding:
In my analysis I have tried to have the analysis through which it is possible to reveal the common characteristics of the best-selling books, but I have not reached a specific reason for making these books in the best-selling list.
But I found some information;
Like not all bestsellers have a high rating.
 * 1- It is not the most expensive books that are popular.
 * 2- The most expensive books are not the ones with the highest ratings and reviews.
 * 4- most common books are found in range 0 to 20 $.
 * 5- non- fiction books are the best seller than fiction books.
 * 6- the price of the books is less in last 3 year.

### In my presentation:
I try to help place your book on the bestseller list by extrapolating the common characteristics from the bestsellers, such that the book is a cheap price and be non-fiction book.
